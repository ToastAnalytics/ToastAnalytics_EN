# Overview

‘Campaign’ in Analytics refers to the in-house campaign. This feature exposes event (mission) to the users through pop-up or banner in the app and provides rewards when the user has joined events.

In-house campaign by the Toast Analytics automatically provides the indices including the surge of user volume due to the campaign as well as the performance analysis from the sales increase. You can also easily target the object meeting the purpose of desired campaign in order to maximize the campaign effect.

You need to go through below processes additionally in order to use the campaign feature. This document includes detailed explanation on how to perform each of the processes.

1.You need to apply Toast Analytics SDK to the app client in order to expose campaign and handle rewards. 
2.You also need a communication between game server (or application server) and campaign server in order to notify the user in case the user had accomplished mission or for checking the rewards.

##Terms
Below terminologies are used in the campaign service.

##Description on Key Synchronizations 

###1. Applying TOAST Analytics SDK 
In order to use Analytics Campaign feature, you first need to apply Toast Analytics SDK to your application. 
Please refer to the end part of this document for more information on application and you can also refer to the “Toast Analytics API Reference” provided additionally. 

###2. Setting a Campaign
Although you can directly create a new campaign, using the template, you can create your desired campaign in an easier and quicker manner. 
You can register a new campaign through the [Run Campaign] in Toast Analytics website. Please refer to the [Page Guide] located on right top of the relevant page for more information.

###3. Registering Test Device 
Before exposing the campaign to the general users, you need to test first to check whether the campaign is normally shown or operating. Before registering the testing device, acquire the Device ID and Device Token first through Toast Analytics SDK.
You may register the testing device by going to Analytics website and clicking [App Setting Button] > [Set Campaign] > [Set Testing Device].

###4. Proceed with the Campaign Test 
Once the testing device is successfully registered, go to [Campaign Operation Menu] > [Campaign List] > [Test Button]in the Toast Analytics website and start testing.

###5. Check Campaign Operation 
And then, you will need to check whether the campaign is operating normally using the testing device. Please check the operation in below 4 stages. Go to the [Page Guide] in the right top of the Toast Analytics website for more information on each stage. 

However, checking mission accomplishment & reward status is available only within the campaigns set with the mission and reward feature.
- Expose: This stage refers to a status when the campaign information has normally been delivered to the testing device, thus being ready to be exposed.
- Implement: It refers to a stage where you had successfully joined the campaign through banner or pop-up exposed in testing device.
- Mission: It refers to a stage where the mission data has been normally delivered from the game server to the campaign server.
- Reward: It refers to a case when the information had been successfully delivered from campaign server to the game server. 

###6. Expose Campaign
Once you had completed the test for campaign, you may open the campaign for external users to access. If the app has reached the campaign exposure location (Refer to ‘Set Campaign > Set Exposure Location’ section) upon campaign launch, the campaign will be revealed to the general users. 

###7. Mission Completion and Rewards 
If a user had conducted a certain action (for instance, a change in level or ranking) to achieve the campaign’s mission, the game server will call campaign server API (check mission) to verify whether the mission had been accomplished or not. 
If the mission is successfully accomplished, the reward information will be sent from the campaign server to the game server and the game server has to send the reward to client based on such information.

##Game Client 

The explanation will be based on Java Code for better understanding of the concept. Please refer to the ‘Programing Guide’ provided respectively for more information on each platform.


##Game Sever

###1. Game Server Authentication
The policy for restricting the access to the campaign server will be changed from ACL to another method. 
The access restriction through ACL from external party is not activated.
Additional task could be required if we decide which authorization policy to adopt. 

###2. Reward
The key task that the game server fulfills regarding the campaign would be ‘handling rewards.’ 
Game must call check-mission API to campaign server in below cases to check whether a mission has been accomplished or not.
- If there is a change in factor (values designated in game such as level, ranking, number of game play, etc.) relating with the mission setting while the campaign is underway 

If a reward is found to be existent upon calling check-mission API to campaign server, you will receive a reward code. After receiving the reward code, send it to the game client. This process shall be implemented within the game. (If reward information is delivered through rewardList field in response data, the delivery will happen only once. What you need to keep in mind here is that even though reward is not present, rewardList field will still be delivered with an empty value.) 

The API format for mission accomplishment that the game server needs to call is listed below.
