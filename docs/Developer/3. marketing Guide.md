## How Marketing Tracking Works
 You can analyze users acquired through advertisement by utilizing TOAST Analytics marketing tracking.

##### <Span style="color:#4B96E6">1) When marketing manager is directing executing ad to media</span>

**(1) For Android**

- Receive Tracking URL from TOAST Analytics and register the URL to ad.
- Once user clicks the ad, click log will be sent.
- Move to store and complete installation, and then a log for identifying ad media will be sent.

**(2) Stores other than Android**

- Stores other than Android do not offer unique identifier such as referrer for tracking users.
- Unique identifier can be created with click log information occurred when user clicks an ad.
- Identifying the same user will be available with the unique identifier created. 
- For instance, as Appstore does not include referrer, tracking users acquired through ad can be done by matching the unique identifier created when installing app in store with identifier created upon clicking an ad.

##### <Span style="color:#4B96E6">2) When executing ad through 3rd Party </span>

- You are able to check installation status with Postback when executing ad through a 3rd party.
- Register TOAST Analytics collection server URL and event to a 3rd party offering the postback feature.
- Enter app information (app/conversion ID) issued by 3rd party to TOAST Analytics.
- Once advertisement is executed, you may track users with information collected through postback.

## Issuing Tracking URL
If you register tracking URL issued by TOAST Analytics to the advertisement you are running, you can see which media user had used for installing the app.


|Terms|Definition|
|:---|:---|
|Tracking URL|URL TOAST Analytics issued for tracking user's installation path.|
|Referrer Channel|Each advertisement media if app had been installed through marketing ad. If a user had directly installed the app in store, the user would be considered to have been acquired naturally.|
|Referrer Path|Path for each referrer channel. For instance, when executing ad to banner on top of Facebook newsletter referrer channel would be Facebook and referrer path would be newsletter top banner.
|3rd party|	As an agency for running ad or measuring performance, 3rd party refers to MAT or AppsFlyer.|
|Event|As an activity occurred within app, event includes level up, currency/weapon acquisition and dungeon joining.|
