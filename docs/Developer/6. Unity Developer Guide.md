# Overview

This document explains the method to implement Analytics SDK on Android. In order to utilize Analytics SDK, one should register for an app. To register, refer to the link (<http://toastanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developer/1.%20Getting%20Started/#registering-app>).
- This document was drawn up based on Unity4 standard.
- Unity plugin function is only supported in Pro version. Therefore, application should be developed through Unity Pro in order to utilize SDK Plugin.
- Android Manifest setting, iOS Build setting, etc. are explained in Programming Guide offered by each OS.



# Project Setting

## SDK downloading

SDK can be downloaded at <http://docs.cloud.toast.com/ko/Download/>

## SDK composition

When it is decompressed after downloading, there are Unity Package files and README.txt files that recorded change history.

```
	Analytics-SDK-Unity /
  - GameAnalyticsUnityPlugin.unitypackage 	// Analytics SDK Unity Package
  - README.txt                     // Release History
```

## Project setting

#### 1. Creating project
Create a new project by executing Unity3D. If there is already created projects, skip this part

![Figure 1 Create Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_unity_001.png)

[Figure 1 Create Project]

#### 2. Adding library
Import downloaded unity package file at Menu of Unity3D by selecting Assets > Import Package > Custom Package

(If google-play-services.jar and AndroidManifest.xml files are included in the version used in the game or in a different library, they don’t have to be added. Contents under “res” folder can be removed along with google-play-services.jar.)

![Figure 2 Adding library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_unity_002.png)

[Figure 2 Adding library]

#### 3. Creating Game Object
Create an empty game object, and then add GameAnalyticsUnityPluginController as a component of game object.

![ Figure 3 Creating Game Object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_unity_003.png)

[Figure 3 Creating Game Object]

#### 4. Utilizing SDK
Then call Action-tracking API at an appropriate point in the game.<br />
Action-tracking API is defined in GameAnalytics.cs.

#### 5. OS additional settings
There are items that should be additionally set into project setting and Manifest setting in each OS (Android, iOS).<br / >
For more details, refer to project setting provision of Programming Guide offered by each OS.


# API Implementation

It is API that should be implemented for the fundamental statistical data gathering. Most of data can be seen just by implementing the mandatory implementation.
API implementation items are the following.

We recommend you to set the API sync scope after logging in to Toast Analytics (please refer to "Top menu bar > Customer Center > View Demo" section for more information.)

|Required|Type|API|Details|Related index|   
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Required|Initialize|initializeSDK|Initialize Client SDK module.|Monitoring / Global Monitoring / Marketing / Referrer & Visit / Churn / User|
|Required|Track section|traceActivation, traceDeactivation|Call when the app is activated in foreground/background.|Monitoring / Global Monitoring / Marketing / Referrer & Visit / Churn / User|
|Required|User type|setUserId|Use when entering user ID upon login. Use in setUserId(userId, true) format only when initializeSdk(..., true) is in use.|Monitoring / Global Monitoring / Marketing / Referrer & Visit / Churn / User|
|Optional|Purchase|tracePurchase|Call when item is purchased within app. (In App Purchase)|Sales / First Purchase / LTV|
|Optional|Acquire/use currency|traceMoneyAcquisition, traceMoneyConsumption|Call when money is acquired or consumed in app.|Balancing|
|Optional|Level up|traceLevelUp|Call during level up.|Balancing|
|Optional|No. of friends|traceFriendCount|Call when tracking number of friends.|Balancing|
|Optional|Custom Event|traceEvent|Call when user defined events occur. |Custom Event|


## Initialization

“App ID” and “Company ID” that are issued after registering for the app are necessarily needed to use SDK. As for the way to register for the app, refer to the link (<http://toastanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developer/1.%20Getting%20Started/#registering-app>)

![Figure 4 Authentication Key Information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToastAnalytics/ToastAnalytics_EN/master/docs/Developer/images/pg_unity_004.png)

[Figure 4 Authentication Key Information]

SDK initialization should be first carried out to utilize GameAnalytics SDK.<br />
The InitializeSDK function of GameAnalytics class is a function that carries out SDK initialization. This function identifies internally needed information (device information, app setting information) and configures the environment for transporting log

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Toast.Analytics;

public class Sample : MonoBehaviour {

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {

     ……

     int result = GameAnalytics.initializeSdk ("APPKEY", "COMPANYID", "VERSION", false);

     if (result != 0) {
        // SDK Initialization failure
     }
     ……

     // Start session-tracking after initialization.
     GameAnalytics.traceActivation()
}
```



# User identification criteria setting
** Criteria should not be changed after opening the game because data link before and after a change can be disconnected during the operation. 

Analytics is a criterion that identifies users, using Advertise ID or User ID. Both ID cannot be used at the same time, but one of them should be chosen according to game policies <br />
Generally speaking, Advertise ID is used as a criterion. But, User ID is permitted in case of special requirements in the game.<br />
For example, if a user drops out and re-registers on the same device under Advertise ID, the user is to be counted as the same previous user. On the other hand, in case of User ID, it is counted as a new user under the same condition.<br />
Or, if one user uses two devices and utilizes Advertise ID, it is counted as two different users, whereas it is counted as just one user in case of User ID.<br />
Considering features of the two different ID types, decide which criteria to use in the game.<br />
This value can be set through the last factor (use logging userid flag) of initialization function (initializeSDK). In the event that Flag is true, use User ID as a criterion. If it is set as False, use Advertise ID as a identification criterion.

The code below is a case of using User ID as the user identification criterion.

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Toast.Analytics;

public class Sample : MonoBehaviour {

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {

     ……
     // Initialization in case of using User ID as user identification criteria
     int result = GameAnalytics.initializeSdk ("APPKEY", "COMPANYID", "VERSION", true);

     if (result != 0) {
        // SDK initialization failure
     }
     ……
     // log-in process completed in the game
     ……
     // a function to register for User ID in case of utilizating User ID as user identification criteria
     GameAnalytics.setUserId(“user_id”, true);
     ……

     // start session-tracking
     GameAnalytics.traceActivation()
}
```

If the last factor of initialization function (use logging userid flag) is set as true, User ID should be registered by calling setUserId. Unless Flag is set as true by calling setUserId, all API called afterwards will return a failure (E_LOGGING_USER_ID_EMPTY).

As for the second factor of setUserId, it is true in case of Promotion or Campaign. Otherwise, it is false.
SetUserId function can be called right after obtaining userID to use in the game after completion of log-in by calling initializeSDK.. UserID can be used as a value utilized to identify game users

As for contents regarding Advertise ID, refer to the link below.

## Session-tracking

It is an implementation to trace DAU (Daily Active User) and stay time in the game <br />
It can be measured by calling a corresponding API in case of App start/end and Background/Foreground move.<br />
When App is first executed (after intializeSDK) or a move from background to foreground is made, start session-tracking by calling traceActivation. And then stop tracking by calling traceDeactivation at the moment of app’s moving into background.<br />
By calling traceDeactivation and measuring stay time between traceActivation and traceDeactivation, total hours of use can be estimated. Also, stop activities carried out internally within SDK at traceDeactivation.<br />
In case of Background/Foreground move, unless the function above hasn’t been called, hours of use in the game cannot be accurately estimated, so this API must be called.<br />
As for DAU, measure it through numbers extracted by getting rid of repetition of the user (Advertise ID or User ID as criteria) who called traceActivation for a day.

```cs
void OnApplicationPause(bool paused) {
    
        if(paused) {
            GameAnalytics.traceDeactivation();
        } else {
            GameAnalytics.traceActivation();
        }
    
}
```

## Action-tracking

This can trace users’ Action on In-App Purchase, money acquisition/consumption, level-up, change in friend count, etc.

#### 1. In-App Purchase
This sends information about purchase by calling tracePurchase after In-App Purchase takes place.<br />
Currency is only used by code defined by ISO-4217(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).<br />
In case of purchasing $0.99jewelry, it is used just as below.<br />
(“GEM_10” here is an item code defined in the game. Unit Cost means corresponding items’ unit price, and payment is the actual cost that users pay. Level is designated for the purchaser’s level.)

```cs
GameAnalytics.tracePurchase("GEM_10", 0.99f, 0.99f, "USD", 10);
```
	
#### 2. Acquisition/Consumption of Goods
This calls when money is either acquired or consumed and traces the amount of change in primary and secondary goods. Generally speaking, primary goods (e.g. jewelry, ruby, etc.) are those purchased through In-App Purchase, while secondary goods (e.g. cherry, heart, etc.) are those purchase by utilizing the primary goods.<br />
In the event that 10 jewels are purchased through IAP, it is used just as below.<br />
(“CODE_IAP” here is a code defined in the game. In case of primary goods, the type is designated as 0, and 1 for secondary goods.)<br />

```cs
GameAnalytics.traceMoneyAcquisition("CODE_IAP", "0", 10, 10);
```
	
In case of purchasing 100 cherries, using 10 jewels, it is used just as described below.

```cs
// consumption of primary goods
GameAnalytics.traceMoneyConsumption("CODE_USE_GEM", "0", 10, 10);

// acquisition of secondary goods
GameAnalytics.traceMoneyAcquisition("CODE_BUY_CHERRY", "1", 100, 10);
```

When secondary goods are purchased by using primary goods, actual move of ‘primary goods decrease’->’secondary goods increase’ takes place. But, if additional goods’ consumption is not necessarily required to be expressed, it is fine to send ‘secondary goods’ increase’ log.

#### 3. Level-up
It calls traceLevelUp when users’ levels are changed. For reference, most of Action-tracking API receives users’ levels in order to trace action for every level.<br />
If a user’s level changes to 10, it is called as below. A user’s level must go up. If it goes down, accurate data cannot be estimated.<br />
For instance, in a game that proceeds through stages like “Candy Crush Sage” in which stage is used as level, only when a user first proceeds into a new stage, corresponding stages should mark a log of level-up. If a user goes back and plays the previous stage, it should not mark a level-up log.<br />
Also, level values that are sent to other API should use the highest stage level value as opposed to the currently ongoing stage

```cs
GameAnalytics.traceLevelUp(10);
```
	
#### 4. Friend
Register numbers of users’ friends. Generally, it is fine to call it at the moment when friend information loading is completed after executing the app

```cs
GameAnalytics.traceFriendCount(100);
```

	
# Optional Implementation

## Using custom event

It can be used to define particulars and analyze them in each game.

### 1. Apply API

```
GameAnalytics.traceEvent("eventType", "eventCode", "param1", "param2", value, level);
```

|Name|Required|type|Reference|   
|---|---|---|---|
|eventType|M|string|Korean available|
|eventCode|M|string|Korean available|
|param1|O|string|Korean available|
|param2|O|string|Korean available|
|value|O|number||
|level|O|number||

String Type Parameter (event type, event code, param1, param2) utilized in traceEvent can be used up to 50byte each. And pram1 that can take place at a low rank of an event can be used up to 300, and param2 that can take place at a low rank of param1 can be used up to 200.

### 2. Use index

Matters to note when designing an event according to purpose are as follows. 

1. Unique event code is recommended for higher readability when inquiring index.
For instance, (Push, push_click, param1, param2, value, level) / (popup, popup_click, param1, param2, value, level) are recommended over (Push, click, param1,param2, value, level) / (popup, click, param1, param2, value, level).

2. Value can be utilized in various areas when you wish to search with benchmarks other than occurrence of a specific event.
For instance, if you leave the point used for reading a certain comic book in E-Book App to the value, you may track the point used daily by entire users reading the comics.
Or if you wish to inquire the index per OS where the event had occurred, set the value as 1 for ios and 0 for aos. The [Number of event - inquiry value] of the event will be tracked as the number of events occurred in aos.

3. Level can be used not only as the game level but also in other ways according to the service characteristic.
For general service app, the level can be mapped with similar standards such as 'member grade.'

For example, in case of Fever Time Item, use it as described below. All the used codes are defined in the game and used. The example provided down below is a code defined to trace change patterns at a particular stage.

```cs
GameAnalytics.traceEvent("ITEM", "ITEM_USE", "FEVER", "STAGE_10", 1, 10);
```
	
It can used to trace Boss Battle results at a particular level.

```cs
GameAnalytics.traceEvent("STAGE", "STAGE_BOSS_VICTORY", "DRAGON_VALLEY", "BOSS_MOB", 1, 10);
```
	
In addition to this, it can be used to trace specialized events for a number of purposes.

String Type Parameter (event type, event code, param1, param2) utilized in traceEvent can be used up to 50byte each. And pram1 that can take place at a low rank of an event can be used up to 300, and param2 that can take place at a low rank of param1 can be used up to 200.

Event Code must be a unique value. Please be careful when setting the event code as the identical event code will lead to the summed up index even with different event type. 

For more details, refer to Toast Analytics website. (It can be downloaded by clicking on "Page Guide" on the upper part of the right side of Custom Event Page.)


## Track Facebook installation
You may track app installation from Facebook ad. This feature uses the Deep Linking feature offered by Facebook. 
Please refer to the Facebook guidelines (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-ads/deep-linking) for more information on tracking and testing. FB.Mobile.FetchDeferredAppLinkData is an API provided by Facebook SDK.
(https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity/reference/current/FB.Mobile.FetchDeferredAppLinkData)

```cs
FB.Mobile.FetchDeferredAppLinkData(DeepLinkCallback);

void DeepLinkCallback(IAppLinkResult result) {
    if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(result.Url)) {
        GameAnalytics.traceFacebookInstall(result.Url);
    }
}
```

## SDK Setting

### 1. Activating debug mode
It can set log output availability for SDK log verification during development.

This function is available both before/after initializeSDK. The default value is setDebugMode(false).

(Start Log tags as “Analytics:” in android. By designating log cat filter as "Analytics" in Eclipse, logs generated in SDK can be identified.)

```cs
void Start () {
     … …
     GameAnalytics.setDebugMode(true);
     … …

     int result = GameAnalytics.initializeSdk ("APPKEY", "COMPANYID", "VERSION", false);

     if (result != 0) {
        // SDK initialization failure
     }
     … …
}
```

In case that debug mode is activated, contents of log delivery can be identified. Whether or not logs are properly delivered can be identified by seeing logs reacted in response after sending logs. If there is log string such as described below, collected data must have been properly delivered to the server. (XXX is an altering value depending on circumstances.)

```
Android : server response (XXX) : 200 OK
iOS : RequestWorkerThread::didReceiveResponse - <NSHTTPURLResponse: XXX> { URL: XXX } { status code: 200002C
```

### 2. Identifying device information
It can identify Device information collected in SDK.

Currently traceable values are Device ID, Campaign User ID. These values are needed to test campaign implementation. For more details, refer to "Campaign implementation guide".

Key values used to identify Device information

- public static final String DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID = “deviceId”;
- public static final String DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID = ”campaignUserId”;

```cs
void printDeviceInfo() {
     string deviceID = GameAnalytics.getDeviceInfo(GameAnalytics.DEVICE_INFO_DEVICEID);
     string campaignUserID = GameAnalytics.getDeviceInfo(GameAnalytics.DEVICE_INFO_CAMPAIGN_USERID);
     … …
}
```
	
### 3. SDK version identification
SDK version can be identified in “PluginVersion” class.

```cs
namespace Toast.Analytics 
{
    public class PluginVersion 
    {
        public const int VersionInt = 0x0100;
        public const string VersionString = "0.1.00";
    }
}
```
